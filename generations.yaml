    description: "The original Chevrolet Trax was a subcompact crossover SUV built on GM's Gamma II platform shared with the Buick Encore. Introduced in global markets in 2013 and arriving in the U.S. for the 2015 model year, it featured a tall, boxy design that maximized interior space within a small footprint. Powered by a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 138 HP, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, it focused on urban usability with city-friendly dimensions and good fuel economy. The interior offered a relatively high seating position and surprising space for its class, with a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system added in later models. A significant refresh in 2017 updated the exterior styling and interior technology. Despite its modest performance, the first-generation Trax found success as an affordable entry point to Chevrolet's SUV lineup, appealing to first-time buyers and urban dwellers seeking versatility in a compact package."

    description: "The completely redesigned second-generation Trax features a dramatic styling transformation with a longer, wider, and lower profile compared to its predecessor. No longer a tall, boxy subcompact SUV, the new Trax adopts sleeker proportions inspired by the larger Blazer, with a coupe-like roofline and more aggressive design elements. Built on a variant of GM's VSS-F platform, it's technically classified as a compact rather than subcompact, with significantly increased dimensions providing more passenger and cargo space. Powered by a 1.2L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 137 HP, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, it's available exclusively with front-wheel drive. The interior represents a major advancement with a standard 8-inch (LT and higher trims: 11-inch) touchscreen infotainment system and an 8-inch digital instrument cluster on higher trims. Standard features include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with available technology including adaptive cruise control, wireless phone charging, and a sunroof. Despite growing in size, the second-generation Trax maintains a value-oriented approach with a starting price lower than many competitors, positioned as an affordable yet stylish and technology-rich alternative to both small SUVs and traditional compact sedans."
